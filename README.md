Hi there! I created a little event-planner for my Hyperion Bootcamp in web dev! I thoroughly enjoyed building this project.

I used:
React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS in addition to Formik, React Router, LocalStorage and of course github!

These tools allowed me to create pages for login, registration, management of events, navigation help, a dashboard and a lovely colour scheme. Users are able to add, edit, delete and track their events :D

Small disclaimer: After I initially uploaded my files when I started, I did not nptice i had to keep pushing my project on here as I went along.
